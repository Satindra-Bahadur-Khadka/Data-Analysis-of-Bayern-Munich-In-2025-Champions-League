This project focuses on analysing Bayern Munich’s performance in the 2025 UEFA Champions League season using publicly available player and match statistics. The analysis highlights player efficiency, goal distribution, and overall team performance compared to other Bundesliga teams. Using Python along with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset was cleaned, filtered, and visualised to uncover key insights. The data, originally sourced from Kaggle and uploaded by Pablo Ramos Wilkins, includes detailed information on player names, nationalities, field positions, and goal metrics such as shots inside and outside the box, as well as preferred foot usage. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of Bayern Munich’s strengths, player contributions, and performance patterns throughout the competition.
